### Final Project for STATS C183 @ UCLA
#### Statistical Models in Finance

I chose 28 stocks from 5 industries using the data from Yahoo Finance (http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/ind_index.html). First, I built models and construct portfolios using data from 2007-12-31 to 2012-12-31.

Later, I used the models based on the historical data to predict portfolio performance from 2012-12-31 to 2015-3-31.

Throughout the project, I explored equal allocation, (**EA**) single index model (**SIM**), constant correlation model (**CCM**) and multigroup model (**MM**).

Specifically, stockPortfolio package in R is used for calculation.
